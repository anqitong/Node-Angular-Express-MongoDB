Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine.

For Windows, make sure you have the folder `C:\data\db` because data will be saved there.


First, start the MongoDB : go to the folder where you installed MongoDB, for example `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin` and open the command prompt. Start the database by writing `mongod.exe` if you are on Windows.

To start the server, go to the root of the `asmundr` project, open the command prompt and write `npm start`.

Open your browser and go to : `http://localhost:3000`

Enjoy!
